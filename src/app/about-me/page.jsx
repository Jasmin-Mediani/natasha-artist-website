          I was born and brought up in a small frontier city deep within
          Eurasia, where the Siberian forests meet the open steppe. Though we
          had no art galleries or museums in my city, we had a lot of art books
          at home. My mother would often look at them with me. She would also
          encourage me to do crafts, which I came to love. Throughout my
          childhood, art enchanted me. Indeed, the earliest memories I have of
          being enchanted was due to works of art seen on holiday or on school
          trips ... the sculpture of a girl in Vorontsov palace in Alupka by
          Quintilio Corbellini ... Archip Kuinziin&apos;s painting of the Dnieper in
          moonlight ... The ability of art to transport me to a special place
          was a leitmotif of my life as I grew up. But my family was practical
          in nature and the thought of going to art school, let alone becoming
          an artist, never entered my mind until much, much later, and in a very
          different place.

          It was only in my early thirties that I tried my hand at art for the
          first time. The spur was a visit to MoMa in Berlin. I had never before
          encountered modern art, and it evoked in me a powerful, visceral
          response completely new to me. I felt called. As soon I returned to
          Florence, where I was living at the time, I enrolled on an art course.
          So began my transformation. Painting and drawing became akin to
          breathing for me. They became my oasis, the place to nurture my soul,
          a fount of solace at difficult moments. I simply could not fathom how
          I had managed to exist up to then without doing art everyday, no
          matter what the circumstances. Perhaps this is what is meant by being
          reborn?

          Since becoming aware of my calling for art, I have remained true to it
          ever since. It has been of tremendous benefit to me psychologically.
          To understand that better, and to help others gain from art as I have,
          I studied for a diploma in art therapy at ArTeA School in Milan. This
          taught me that art is above all a language, with the capacity to
          reveal otherwise hidden aspects of one&apos;s being. While working for my
          diploma, I witnessed individuals deemed lost causes by almost
          everyone, inhabiting the shadows without hope of a future, who by
          doing art discovered to their surprise and delight that they have
          talents. This gave them the confidence to enter society and work
          towards realising their potential.

          This understanding informs me as an art teacher and the art I do.
          Knowing the language of art and how it is articulated in practice
          enables me to guide my students to discern the means best - and
          uniquely - suited to them to achieve their goals. This understanding
          has also proved invaluable for my own artwork. My metier as an artist
          is painting. I like to paint flowers and animals. However, I am
          especially fascinated by portraiture. A face for me is a very
          personal, idiosyncratic landscape, reflecting a person&apos;s journey
          through life. When I paint someone&apos;s portrait, I travel the landscape
          of his life and give it artistic form. As I do that, I am acutely
          conscious of the painting&apos;s ability to influence that person&apos;s sense
          of self and to shape the environment in which it will be placed. In
          the portraits I paint, I thus focus on the brighter side of the lives
          of the people shown and on the prospects for a heartening future.
